# RainWaterMonitoring
Ardunio based rain water quality montoring station


A project financed by the [ABCD Centre](https://abcd-centre.org) carried out at the IIT Madras at the laboratories of [Prof. Venkatraman Srinivasan](https://home.iitm.ac.in/venkatraman/Venkatraman.htm).
The aim of was to develop a protoype sensor to measure water quality parameters from rain water runoff from roofs. Roof water harvesting is a promising system for the collection of rainwater in urban areas. 
Besides the use of the collected water in households it is also a technology that, if used widespread, significantly reduces the occurrence of urban flooding as well as the hydraulic stress on sewers and receiving water bodies.
However, runoff in urban has not drinking water quality and assessment of its quality is important to apply it appropriately. Especially particles and particle bound pollutants are a matter of concern for using rainwater collected from roofs. 
Particle transport from surfaces commonly follows the “first flush” phenomena, where the maximum event load is occurring at the beginning of a rain event. To prevent this flush to enter storages or infiltration wells monitoring and divertion are promising technologies. To test the applicabilty of low cost sensors for this purpose this project developed a protoype and a sketch for an ardunio based solution.  
The [sketch](https://github.com/Jakobbenisch/RainWaterMonitoring/blob/main/sketch) and the the [wiki](https://github.com/Jakobbenisch/RainWaterMonitoring/wiki) should support further improvements.
